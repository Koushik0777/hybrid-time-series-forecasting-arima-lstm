## Problem Statement
Explore time-series forecasting techniques using historical stock price data.

## Data
Publicly available historical stock prices.

## Approach
- Time series analysis and stationarity checks
- ARIMA for linear patterns
- LSTM for non-linear temporal patterns
- Comparison of model behavior

## Evaluation
- Train-test split based on time
- Error metrics (RMSE / MAE)
- Visual comparison of forecasts

## Limitations
- Stock markets are noisy and non-stationary
- Forecasts are not investment advice
- Not suitable for real trading systems
